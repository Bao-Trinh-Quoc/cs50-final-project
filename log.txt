Init new project: Write a text editor from scratch
for compiles, run the following command:
-----> cc edito.c -o edito

in MakeFile:
-----> $(CC) edito.c -o edito -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c99	

* $(CC) is a variable that holds the name of the compiler.
* -Wall : all warnings: enable all the warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid
* -Wextra : extra warnings: This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by -Wall
* -pedantic : issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++
* -std=c99 : use the C99 standard

running make edito will compile the program

---- add enableRawMode and disableRawMode functions to enable and disable raw mode respectively

Ctrl-C is the interrupt signal, which is sent to a process by the kernel in order to request its termination. 
By default, this causes the process to terminate with a SIGINT signal.

Ctr-Z is the suspend signal, which is sent to a process by the kernel in order to request its suspension.

Ctrl-Q is the XON character, which is used for software flow control.

Ctrl-S is the XOFF character, which is used for software flow control.

---- Note: problem with Ctrl-V when using it in the terminal, it is used to paste text, 
so it is not possible to use it as a key binding.

complete entering raw mode 

############## 14/08/2024 #############
changed from q to Ctrl-Q to quit the program
Simpilified main function by added editorProcessKeypress function
--- refresh screen after every keypress
--- added tildes like vim ;0 but with this I will draw *

Reminders: Needed to split the code into multiple files
Done!

Reminders: Needed to learn how to branch and merge in git and applied it to my current project for learning purposes
(doesn't needed to do it right now bcs the size of this project is small)

############## 18/08/2024 #############
Added fallback method for getting the windows size if the ioctl() method fails

added welcome message and fix some bugs

############## 19/08/2024 #############

Implement move cursor with arrow keys 

* Prevent the cursor from going out of the screen
* Implement PageUp and PageDown keys

Depeneding on OS, 
---> the HOME key could be <esc>[1~, <esc>[7~, <esc>[H, or <esc>OH
---> the END key could be <esc>[4~, <esc>[8~, <esc>[F, or <esc>OF            

Make the HOME/END move the cursor to the left/right edge of the screen <FOR NOW>

FUNFACT: YOU CANNOT DECLARE VARIABLES DIRECTLY IN THE SWITCH STATEMENT IN C --- so I needed to create a code block for this.

DEL_KEY: <esc>[3~ <--- will be used to delete a character at the cursor position later

############## 22/08/2024 #############
Implement read file from disk and display it on the screen
Implement vertical scrolling
Implement horizontal scrolling

Added:
    * Limit scrolling to the right
    * Snap cursor to the end of line
    * Moving left at the start of line
    * Moving right at the end of line

Make Page Up and Page Down move the cursor to the top and bottom of the screen respectively
Make End move to the end of line

Call it a day! (step 93) <--- Half a way yeaayayya!!

############## 24/08/2024 #############
Added status bar to the bottom of the screen
Added msg bar to display messages to the user
Upgrade text viewr to text editor
* Save to disk
Allow users to edit files and save it to the disk 
* Backspace and Enter key

stop at step 111. Will complete text editor tonight!
Implement confirm to quit if the file is not saved

Implement Backspace containing the following:
    * Allow to delete characters and move the cursor to the left
    * When delete a character at the start of the line, it will join the current line with the previous line
Implement Enter containing the following:
    * Allow to insert a new line and move the cursor to the next line
    * When Enter is pressed at the end of the line, it will insert a new line at the end of the file
Implement save feauture: Allow user to create a new file by calling ./Edito then give it a name

############## 25/08/2024 #############

#### Weird bug: There is still one redundant line at the end of the file. ####

Implement search feature:
    * Allow user to search for a word in the file
    * Allow user to move to the next occurence of the word
    * Allow user to move to the previous occurence of the word
    * Allow user to exit the search mode

git branch - list, create, delete, rename, and switch branches
git checkout - switch branches or restore working tree files
git checkout -b - create a new branch and switch to it

git diff - Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
