Init new project: Write a text editor from scratch

for compiles, run the following command:
-----> cc edito.c -o edito

in MakeFile:
-----> $(CC) edito.c -o edito -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c99	

* $(CC) is a variable that holds the name of the compiler.
* -Wall : all warnings: enable all the warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid
* -Wextra : extra warnings: This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by -Wall
* -pedantic : issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++
* -std=c99 : use the C99 standard

running make edito will compile the program

---- add enableRawMode and disableRawMode functions to enable and disable raw mode respectively

Ctrl-C is the interrupt signal, which is sent to a process by the kernel in order to request its termination. 
By default, this causes the process to terminate with a SIGINT signal.

Ctr-Z is the suspend signal, which is sent to a process by the kernel in order to request its suspension.

Ctrl-Q is the XON character, which is used for software flow control.

Ctrl-S is the XOFF character, which is used for software flow control.

---- Note: problem with Ctrl-V when using it in the terminal, it is used to paste text, 
so it is not possible to use it as a key binding.

complete entering raw mode 

############## 14/08/2024 #############
changed from q to Ctrl-Q to quit the program
Simpilified main function by added editorProcessKeypress function
--- refresh screen after every keypress
--- added tildes like vim ;0 but with this I will draw *

Reminders: Needed to split the code into multiple files
Done!

Reminders: Needed to learn how to branch and merge in git and applied it to my current project for learning purposes
(doesn't needed to do it right now bcs the size of this project is small)

############## 18/08/2024 #############
Added fallback method for getting the windows size if the ioctl() method fails

git branch - list, create, delete, rename, and switch branches
git checkout - switch branches or restore working tree files
git checkout -b - create a new branch and switch to it

git diff - Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
