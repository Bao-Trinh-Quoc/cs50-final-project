Init new project: Write a text editor from scratch

for compiles, run the following command:
-----> cc edito.c -o edito

in MakeFile:
-----> $(CC) edito.c -o edito -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c99	

* $(CC) is a variable that holds the name of the compiler.
* -Wall : all warnings: enable all the warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid
* -Wextra : extra warnings: This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by -Wall
* -pedantic : issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++
* -std=c99 : use the C99 standard

running make edito will compile the program

---- add enableRawMode and disableRawMode functions to enable and disable raw mode respectively

Ctrl-C is the interrupt signal, which is sent to a process by the kernel in order to request its termination. 
By default, this causes the process to terminate with a SIGINT signal.

Ctr-Z is the suspend signal, which is sent to a process by the kernel in order to request its suspension.

Ctrl-Q is the XON character, which is used for software flow control.

Ctrl-S is the XOFF character, which is used for software flow control.

---- Note: problem with Ctrl-V when using it in the terminal, it is used to paste text, 
so it is not possible to use it as a key binding.

complete entering raw mode 

############## 14/08/2024 #############
changed from q to Ctrl-Q to quit the program
Simpilified main function by added editorProcessKeypress function
--- refresh screen after every keypress
--- added tildes like vim ;0 but with this I will draw *

Reminders: Needed to split the code into multiple files
Done!

Reminders: Needed to learn how to branch and merge in git and applied it to my current project for learning purposes

git branch - list, create, delete, rename, and switch branches
git checkout - switch branches or restore working tree files
git checkout -b - create a new branch and switch to it

git diff - Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
