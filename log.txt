Init new project: Write a text editor from scratch

for compiles, run the following command:
-----> cc edito.c -o edito

in MakeFile:
-----> $(CC) edito.c -o edito -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c99	

* $(CC) is a variable that holds the name of the compiler.
* -Wall : all warnings: enable all the warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid
* -Wextra : extra warnings: This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by -Wall
* -pedantic : issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++
* -std=c99 : use the C99 standard

running make edito will compile the program

---- add enableRawMode and disableRawMode functions to enable and disable raw mode respectively

Ctrl-C is the interrupt signal, which is sent to a process by the kernel in order to request its termination. 
By default, this causes the process to terminate with a SIGINT signal.

Ctr-Z is the suspend signal, which is sent to a process by the kernel in order to request its suspension.

Ctrl-Q is the XON character, which is used for software flow control.

Ctrl-S is the XOFF character, which is used for software flow control.

-Note: problem with Ctrl-V when using it in the terminal, it is used to paste text, 
so it is not possible to use it as a key binding.
